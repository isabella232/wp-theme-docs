	<h2 id="post-types">Post Types</h2>
	<p>
		Every post type has its own features. Let's take a look at them:
	</p>
	<h3 id="page">Page</h3>
	<p>
		The WP build-in page post types benefit two features:
	</p>
	<h4>Page Templates</h4>
	<p>
		One can select from several different page templates layouts available for the regular theme. The default template has the sidebar on the left:
	</p>
	<img src="images/page.jpg" alt="Page">
	<h4>CarPress Options Meta Box</h4>
	<p>
		To every page it is possible to add the Subtitle. The subtitle is displayed right below the main title of the page:
	</p>
	<img src="images/subtitle.jpg" alt="Subtitle Page">
	<h3 id="slider">Slider</h3>
	<p>
		This post type is used to add slides to the front page with slider.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optimal image sizes for the slider are <b>1920 (width) x 592 (height) px</b>. If the uploaded image is larger, the WP automatically resizes it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The image used must be uploaded as the <b>Featured Image</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		More settings for the slider (interval, text background color and opacity) can be found in the <b>Appearance » Customize » Front page and Banners</b>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
	<h4>CarPress Options Meta Box</h4>
	<p>
		There are two options in the Carpress Options Meta Box for the Services. You can define the subtitle for the service (like for the page) and in addition you can select if you wish that this service is displayed on the front page in the Services Widget.
	</p>
	<h4>Attributes</h4>
	<img class="alignright" src="images/order.jpg" alt="Order">
	<p>
		The order of the services is controlled by the Order under Attributes:
	</p>
	<h4>Excerpt</h4>
	<p>
		The text displayed on the front page can be altered using the <b>Excerpt</b> textarea:
	</p>
	<img src="images/excerpt.jpg" alt="Excerpt">
	<div class="info">
		Note that you need to display some meta boxed using the button <b>Screen Options</b> at the top of the admin panel.
	</div>
	<h3 id="gallery">Gallery</h3>
	<p>
		We made adding the galleries much easier for the end user. Everything is done using the WP build-in gallery builder, when adding a new media. Like for the Services you can also change subtitle.
	</p>
	<h3 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h3>
	<p>
		The title of the author of the testimonials can be added in the Testimonial Options.<br>
		The Order attribute will be used to order the testimonials. Lower numbers will display faster.
