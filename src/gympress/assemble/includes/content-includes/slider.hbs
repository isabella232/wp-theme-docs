		Building a Theme slider has never been easier.<br>
		You can create a Theme slider on any page you want. The only thing you must do is choose the page template <b>Front Page With Slider</b> (you can use this template even if it's not for the front page). After you select this page template there will be a new meta box at the bottom of the page which is called <b>Front page slider</b>. Now you can add images or videos to your slider.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you add a video, you also have to upload a video "thumbnail", which will serve as a clickable area (also a play button overlay will be added to this image). When a user clicks on this image, the video will open in a pop-up modal window.
	</p>
	<p>As you can see on the example image bellow, you also have the <strong>Slider settings</strong> tab. In Slider settings tab, you can change how the slider behaves and change the slider options.</p>
	<p>This is how the slider backend looks like:</p>

		Please take a look at this <a href="https://support.proteusthemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/203540492-Slider-dimensions" target="_blank">slider dimensions article</a> for the recommended size of the slider images for this theme.

		You can also use Layer/Revolution Slider. We don't include them with the theme but we make sure they work. When you activate page template - <b>Front Page With Layer/Revolution Slider</b> there is new field in which you can put id/alias from Layer/Revolution Slider.
