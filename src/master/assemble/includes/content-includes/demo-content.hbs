		You can import demo content from our demo site (with blurred licensed images) with a single click of a button. Go to <i>Appearance » Import Demo Data</i> and click on the import button.

	<h3 id="import-xml-file">Import XML File</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to import the demo content the old-fashioned way, you can get a fresh copy of the <strong>XML file</strong> on our server at this URL: <a href="http://artifacts.proteusthemes.com/xml-exports/{{demo-content.theme}}-latest.xml">http://artifacts.proteusthemes.com/xml-exports/{{demo-content.theme}}-latest.xml</a>. Don't forget to activate all required plugins before importing demo data. To import the demo data go to <i>Tools » Import</i>, click on <i>WordPress</i> (install the <strong>WordPress Importer</strong> plugin if not already installed) and upload/import the previously saved xml file (don't forget to enable the <i>Download and import file attachments</i> checkbox to also import the images).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Demo Widgets</b><br>After you import the demo content, you can also import widgets the old-fashioned way. The file for widget import is also located on our server: <a href="http://artifacts.proteusthemes.com/json-widgets/{{demo-content.theme}}.json">http://artifacts.proteusthemes.com/json-widgets/{{demo-content.theme}}.json</a>. Rename this file to <code>{{demo-content.theme}}.wie</code> (mind the file extension) and use it in the plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/" target="_blank">Widget Importer &amp; Exporter</a>. Go to <i>Tools » Widget Import/Export</i> and import the file.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>After import setup</b><br>After you have imported the demo data and widgets, you should also setup these things:
		{{!-- After Import setup --}}
		{{> after-import-setup}}
	</p>
	<p>
		If for some reason these URLs are not available, then all you need to do is download the <strong>All files & documentation</strong> zip from ThemeForest and you will find the <strong>content.xml</strong> and <strong>widgets.json</strong> file in the <strong>extras</strong> folder.
