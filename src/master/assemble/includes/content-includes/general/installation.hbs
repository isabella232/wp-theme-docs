<p>
	I assume you already have a fresh copy of <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> installed on your server.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Download the theme zip file</b><br>
	The first thing you will need to do is to download the theme installation zip file.
</p>
<p>
	If you bought the theme on our <a href="https://www.proteusthemes.com/" target="_blank">ProteusThemes Shop</a>, you should have received an email with the list of themes you have access to. You can click on the theme link with file name ending: <b>-installable.zip</b> or you can <a href="https://www.proteusthemes.com/account/" target="_blank">login to your account</a> and download the installable zip file from there.
</p>
<p>
	If you bought the theme on ThemeForest, then you have to download the <i>installable WordPress files only</i> zip file from the <a href="https://themeforest.net/downloads" target="_blank">ThemeForest download section</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Install the theme</b><br>
	You can install the {{general.themeName}} Theme in two different ways:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Upload a zip file</strong><i> - preferred method</i><br>
		When you are logged in your WordPress dashboard go to <i>Appearance » Themes » Add New » Upload Theme</i> and select the theme installation zip file you downloaded from our Shop or from the ThemeForest and click <b>Install Now</b> button.
	</li>
	<li><strong>FTP upload</strong><br>
		Unzip the contents of the theme installation zip file and upload the extracted folder to your server to <code>wp-uploads/themes/</code> folder using a FTP client.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Once your theme is on the server, activate it by clicking the <b>Activate</b> button below the preview image in <i>Appearance » Themes</i>
</p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="images/activate-theme.png" alt="Activate {{general.themeName}}">
<p>
	Congratulations! Now the {{general.themeName}} Theme is installed.
</p>
<div class="warning">
	You still need to install/activate the required and recommended plugins - you can do this by visiting <b>Appearance » Install Plugins</b> inside wp-admin.
