<p>
	You can use almost any widget in the Page Builder. Let's take a look at few not so straight forward ones.
</p>
<h4>SiteOrigin Editor Widget</h4>
<p>
	SiteOrigin Editor will create you the same editor environment as a normal WordPress editor does. You can use this widget if you want normal text editing options. SiteOrigin Editor Widget is part of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/" target="_blank">Site Origin Widgets Bundle</a>.

<h4 id="portfolio-grid-widget">Portfolio Grid</h4>
<p>
	Portfolio Grid Widget has default light skin, but there is also option to make it look good on darker background. To achieve that, you must edit row where Portfolio Grid is and insert class <code>portfolio-grid--dark</code> in the Attributes -> Row Class.
