<h3 id="page-builder-widgets">Page Builder Widgets</h3>
<p>
	You can use almost any widget in the Page Builder. Let's take a look at few not so straight forward ones.
</p>
<h4>SiteOrigin Editor Widget</h4>
<p>
	SiteOrigin Editor will create you the same editor environment as a normal WordPress editor does. You can use this widget if you want normal text editing options. SiteOrigin Editor Widget is part of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/" target="_blank">Site Origin Widgets Bundle</a>.

<h4 id="portfolio-grid-widget">Portfolio Grid</h4>
<p>
	Portfolio Grid Widget has default light skin, but there is also option to make it look good on darker background. To achieve that, you must edit row where Portfolio Grid is and insert class <code>portfolio-grid--dark</code> in the Attributes -> Row Class.
</p>

<h4 id="instagram-widget">Instagram Widget</h4>
<p>
	You will be able to display your Instagram images in a very nice responsive row and have an optional call-to-action box:
	<img src="images/instagram-widget.png" alt="Instagram widget">
</p>
<p>
	Just follow these instructions and get your <strong>access token</strong> and your <strong>user id</strong> from Instagram and you are good to go:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="https://apps.proteusthemes.com/instagram/get-access-token.php" target="_blank">Login and get your Instagram Access Token and User ID</a>,</li>
	<li>Once you complete the authentication steps, copy the Access Token and the User ID to the appropriate fields in the widget settings.</li>
</ol>
